# LEETCODE-Array-1636
It looks like you're sharing a Java method for sorting an array based on the frequency of elements, and then by value in descending order for elements with the same frequency. Let's break down the code and understand how it works step-by-step.

### Breakdown of the `frequencySort` Method

1. **Initialization:**
    ```java
    int[] cnt = new int[201];
    List<Integer> t = new ArrayList<>();
    ```
    - `cnt` is an array of size 201, which will be used to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `nums`. The size 201 is chosen because the range of `nums` is assumed to be from -100 to 100, and we offset each number by 100 to use it as an index in `cnt`.
    - `t` is a list that will hold the transformed values of `nums` (each value increased by 100).

2. **Counting and Transforming:**
    ```java
    for (int v : nums) {
        v += 100;
        ++cnt[v];
        t.add(v);
    }
    ```
    - For each value `v` in `nums`, we increment it by 100 and count its occurrences in `cnt`.
    - We also add the transformed value (v + 100) to the list `t`.

3. **Sorting:**
    ```java
    t.sort((a, b) -> cnt[a] == cnt[b] ? b - a : cnt[a] - cnt[b]);
    ```
    - We sort the list `t` using a custom comparator. The comparator sorts first by the frequency of the values (`cnt[a] - cnt[b]`).
    - If two values have the same frequency, it sorts them by value in descending order (`b - a`).

4. **Restoring Original Values:**
    ```java
    int[] ans = new int[nums.length];
    int i = 0;
    for (int v : t) {
        ans[i++] = v - 100;
    }
    return ans;
    ```
    - After sorting, we create a new array `ans` to store the sorted values.
    - We iterate over the sorted list `t`, subtract 100 from each value to restore the original values, and store them in `ans`.
    - Finally, we return the sorted array `ans`.

### Example Usage

Let's consider an example to illustrate how this method works:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] nums = {4, 6, 2, 4, 3, 6, 2, 4};
    Solution sol = new Solution();
    int[] sorted = sol.frequencySort(nums);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sorted));
}
```

In this example, the input array `nums` is `[4, 6, 2, 4, 3, 6, 2, 4]`.

1. **Counting Occurrences:**
    - 4 appears 3 times
    - 6 appears 2 times
    - 2 appears 2 times
    - 3 appears 1 time

2. **Sorting:**
    - Frequency of 3 < Frequency of 2 and 6 < Frequency of 4
    - Between 2 and 6, the descending order value preference is 6, then 2.

3. **Result:**
    - The sorted array should be `[3, 6, 6, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4]`.

### Conclusion

The `frequencySort` method effectively sorts an array based on the frequency of elements and then by value in descending order for elements with the same frequency. If you have any specific questions or further modifications in mind, feel free to ask!
